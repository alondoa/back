<h3>Backgammon Rules</h3>




Understand the backgammon board. Backgammon is played on a board that consists of 24 narrow triangles that are called points. The triangles alternate in color and are grouped into four quadrants of six triangles each. There are four types of quadrants: the player's home board and outer board, and the opponent's home board and outer board. The intersection of these four quadrants, the middle of the board, is separated by a ridge called the bar.[1]

    The players sit facing each other at opposite sides of the board when they play. Each player's home board is positioned on the right quadrant closest to the player. The home boards are opposite each other, and so are the outer boards, which are located in the left quadrant.
    The player moves his checkers from the direction of the other player's home board in a horse-shoe like direction, moving counterclockwise.
    The triangles are numbered from 1-24 in most of the Backgammon boards, with the 24th point being the furthest point from the player, and with 1 being the right most triangle on the player's home court. The players must move their pieces from opposite sides of the board, so one player's 1st point is the other player's 24th point, one player's 2nd point is the other player's 23rd point, and so on.





Set up the board. Each player must set up his 15 checkers for the game to begin. The players' checkers will be comprised of two distinct colors, traditionally white and red, or white and black but it can also be other colors. To set up the board, each player must place two checkers on their 24 point, three checkers on his 8 point, five checkers on his 13 point, and five more checkers on his 6 point.[2]

    Remember that each player has his own numbering system, so the checkers will not overlap.





Roll a die to determine who goes first. The player who rolls the highest number will go first. If both players roll the same number, roll again. The numbers rolled will count as the first moves for the player with the highest number. For example, if one player rolled a 5 and the other rolled a 2, then the player who rolled the 5 would go first and use the 5 and 2 in lieu of a new dice roll.[3] 






Remember that you can double the stakes at any time. In backgammon, the winner doesn't gain points, but the loser loses points. So if you win, the opponent will either lose based on the face value, double value, or triple value of the stakes on the doubling cube. The doubling cube isn't a die but a marker. It starts at 1, but you can raise the stakes at any time at the beginning of your turn before you have rolled the dice.[4]

    If you want to double the stakes and your partner accepts, then the cube is turned to the new number and placed in your opponent's court. He will have ownership of the cube and will be able to propose a doubling during any of his future turns.
    If your opponent does not accept your offer, he must forfeit the game and lose by the original stakes.
    You can keep doubling the stakes back and forth, or redoubling, but it's not traditionally done more than three or four times in a game.






Roll the dice. Use a dice tumbler to roll two six-sided dice once during each of your turns. The numbers rolled represent two separate moves. For example, if you roll a 3 and a 5, you can move one checker three spaces and another checker 5 spaces. Or, you can move one checker 3 spaces and then 5 more spaces.[5]

    Make sure that you roll the dice to the right of your side of the board, from a reasonable height so that they bounce and roll a bit.
    If either of the dice lands on a checker, outside of the board, or leaning against the edge of the board, then it is not considered valid and you will have to reroll.






Move your checkers to an open point. An open point is any point on the board that is not occupied by two or more opposing checkers. You can move your checkers to a point with no checkers on it, a point with one or more of your checkers on it, or a point with one of your opponent's checkers on it. Remember that you should always move your checkers counter-clockwise, moving from your opponent's home court to your own.[6]

    You can start with any checker you chose, but it is a good idea to get your checkers out of your opponentâ€™s home board as soon as possible.
    You only need 2 checkers to block a point, but you can have as many of your checkers as you want on a single point.
    Remember that you can either move one checker twice or move two checkers once. For example, if you roll a 3-2, you can move one checker 3 points over and then 2 points over, as long as it lands on an open point both times. Alternately, you can move one checker 2 points over to an open point, and move another checker 3 points over to an open point.
